# Personal Site
----------------
Overview: 
This was a project I started in high school, when I was 15-16 years old. This project served as opportunity to teach myself front-end web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Javascript. I started making this website by teaching myself, mainly using w3schools. After a few months I took a web design class in high school and expanded the website. Note: Website was never fully optimized, website may look unpleasent with some screen sizes.
